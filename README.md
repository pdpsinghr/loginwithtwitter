# loginwithtwitter
user can login using twitter and nodejs passport

# How it works
you have two seprate folder one orr frontend i used VueJs for frontend and secondone is backend there i used nodejs express

# for frontend 

to run front-end you have to go in frontend folder and then run NPM INSTALL
and then for run the app use "npm run dev"

# for backend

to run backend go to the twitt folder and then run npm install

for authorization you need twitter developer account there you have to create developer account and there when you create app then it will provide you consumer key and consumer key secret

And it also provide auth token and auth token secret
you have to pass all consumerkey and consumerkey secret in passport for twitter authanticate

i also use another library for getting all tweets from twitter that is "twit" you have to pass all four things in twit

now in root folder you  jast have to run nodemon


and here you go when you click on login it will open a window that get data from twitter and then pass it to the vue and show all tweets ther you find functionlity of pagination and also find search on the basis of location.
